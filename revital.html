                <h2>Identify the Problems</h2>
                <p>The theme for our final product is improving health. We began by thinking of and listing out any health related app ideas we could from combating substance abuse, to dealing with stress, to helping predict illness using sweat or spit samples,
                    to deciding when to have a cup of coffee to maximize its positive benefits, to a jet-lag fighter. <b>Carly’s challenges are inspired from real data we gathered during our interviews, surveys and usability testings.</b></p>
                <p>Then we started to define the main features of our app:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <div class="content1">Solve the issue of Chronic Fatigue</div>

                    we proceed to discuss the potential features of our app, we first conducted the competitors analysis to see how can we develop new ideas and concepts.

                        For the design, we were inspired by minimalistic applications. Our main goal is to create an interface that is user-friendly and adovated for any user. However, the color scheme of the application has been changed to a blue color palette. We decided to
                        finalize on softer pastel colors since it correlates with sleep to an extent, but it still enhances light. We are focusing on helping our users with chronic whether it is during the day or during the night, therefore, we wanted
                        our color scheme to correlate with the purpose of the app.</li>

                <p>For our future plan, we want to build more features and have deep integration with more of the fitness trackers on the market to become a universal solution. Additionally, we want to enlarge our user groups and promote this product to
