                <h2>Project Introduction</h2>

                <p><b>The problem is that residents within different communities have limited access to reliable sources on the impact COVID-19 has within their local counties. Between 2005 and 2015, the rates of social media and social networking usage significantly increased with nearly 65% of all adults and 35% of 65 and older report using social media sites as sources where they can access and share information about health, political deliberation, and communication patterns around the globe.

                <h2>Proposed Solution</h2>
                <p>
                    A system needs to be established that sends relevant push notifications to phones when there is an update regarding COVID-19 information.

                </p>

                </article>
                <p>Finding credible information about COVID-19 at local levels is difficult. Our application, ViFo, empowers people with local knowledge to make informed decisions with their communities in mind. Features include a dashboard with COVID-19 data, customizable news feeds, push notifications, and maps of local resources.

                <h2>Use Cases</h2>
                <p>Our application will be used by people living in areas affected by COVID-19 that wish to be informed of the impact the virus has had within their communities. While our app is not intended for a specific age range of users, we did design the application with older demographics in mind as they tend to experience more technical difficulties than younger users. 
                </p>
                <img  style="margin: auto; " src="assets/images/vifoPicture.png " width="750 " />

                <p>The first use case is simple: people will be presented with a dashboard that presents an overview of COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries in their areas along with guidelines on how to be responsible in wake of the pandemic, implement prevention techniques, and create treatments.</p>
                <p>The second use case is similar to the first as users are still being presented with information but this time it is a news feed of articles and other resources curated based on the tags the user has set in their preferences and other filters like trending.

                <h4 style="font-style: normal; ">User Research</h4>
                    <p>
                        The information that is available to the public is sometimes messy (hard to find or understand). In addition, many people have been affected in different ways and we wanted to get a better understanding of what the people needed order to get a better understanding of the whole situation. Thus, we sent out surveys to get key insights from these questionnaries.  </p>
                        <img class="browser-screenshot " style="margin: auto; " src="assets/images/covidSurvey.png " width="800 " />
                        <br />
                        <p>Based on 44 responses we received so far, the majority of the respondents said that they would like to have access to more statistics and community information regarding the pandemic. I then started thinking What information do people think will be useful in an application to educate a community about the current situation with COVID-19?</p>
                <br />
                    <h4 style="font-style: normal; ">In-depth Interview</h4>
                    <p>
                        For the next phase, we conducted 9 video interviews with people who work in different industries. Despite the general user testing questions, I asked specific questions about their basic needs during this pandemic. Even though the interviewees have different occupations, I noticed that their common goal is to gather the most important and relevant information into a single app. Thus, I led our team to transform these user needs into the high-fidelity prototypes.

                <h4>Dashboard</h4>
                <p>The dashboard displays the latest statistics (confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries) regarding patients as well as the updates on public facilities, we deliver first-hand information on the reoepning of restaurants and stores.

                <img style="margin: auto; padding-bottom: 5%; " src="assets/images/dashboard.png " width="1000 " />

                <h4>News</h4>
                <p>Based on users' selected topics, the application provides up to date news articles and videos uner the info feed tab.

                <h4>Map Function</h4>
                <p>ViFo provides our users with an interactive map screen where they can find the nearest grocery stores, hospitals, testing sites, and pharmacies. In addition, ViFo will display the amount of human activity at those locations as well as
                    establishment protocols and suppply list.

                <h4>Profile Screen</h4>
                <p style="width: 50%; float: left; margin-top: 5%; ">I also suggested out team to design a profile screen which helps users to access to their saved articles and edit info feed settings. The in-depth interviews I conducted showed that the majority of the users would like to customize the
                    notification system and interested topics to make sure they only receive high quality news.

                    <h2>Next Step</h2>
                    <p>We believe that our main application, ViFo, is mostly complete at this point. Our main objective is to get mass feedback from stakeholders to gauge how ViFo will perform for them at their local levels. The feedback poses as leverage
                        to continue to iteratively improve upon our work.

                    </p>
                    <p>Our team is still collaborating in order to decide on the best solution for the waitlist feature. One solution we have devised is to have a separate version of the application for the establishments to update their waitlists and have
                        that reflected in the consumer's application.
