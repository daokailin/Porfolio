                <h2>Identify the Problems</h2>
                <p>The current Linkedln mobile app is lacking the basic meetup function as a social media platform geared to professionals. The existing "My Network" function doesn't provide users with appropriate meeting opportunities to communicate with
                    people who share the same interests and passions in person. </p>
                <p>Thus, we are dedicated to implement a new function that helps users to learn knowledgeable skills and industry experience through "real connection."</p>

                <p>1. We sent out online google form surveys to our friends and colleagues who have used the linkedln app before. The goal of using this method was to see how college graduates interact with the existing group feature and find out the trends
                    of their expectations or needs of networking experience.
                </p>
                <p>2. Our team conducted two observational interviews to collect more in-depth information about these participants' user experiences. We asked them to share their experience of meeting with professionals on linkedln, and we recorded how
                    they used the My Network feature to find their interested groups. </p>

                        travelers. The products showing above require extensive amount of data input; however, our app only takes 1-2 minutes and is more accurate.

                <h2>Competitor Analysis</h2>
                <p>Since group feature has been widely used in other popular social media platforms, we used Competitor analysis to research how well are they served the users and what's their primary features.</p>
                <p>As we can see, most competitive products are lack of social elements which helps users to gain the sense of communities and belongings. Without the function that enables users to connect with others personally, the group feature will lose
                    its value. Additionally, we found that we could add a filter to allow users to target their interested groups/events, and we are also considering implement recommendation system to remind users the upcoming events or interesting news.

                <p>The following feature flow chart illustrates our "group-based " UX flow, which is aimed to build broader interpersonal connection within the local communities that formed by people who shared the same passions. The current linkedln group
                    function is only accessible after users open the menu bar. Thus, we decided

In addition to the group function button at the bottom bar, user can also access it through tooltips on the top of the screen, which is more visible and reminds
                    them of this function. Based on user feedback, we intended to make the experience of accessing the funciton differently based on user’s habit and frequency. So ideally the top tooltips can be toggled off automatically and the app knows
                    that the user has been accessing the function frequently. It will appear again if the users haven’t used it in a while.</p>

There is a “dicover groups” section in the middle of the screen, and users
                    can manually search groups. This section exists to invite the users to explore the function and gives them a starting point, while also telling them what this function does. Below that are various recommended groups that are based
                    on users’ career interests and profile information. </p>

The biggest feature is that users can easily connect with the experienced professionals who host the event by clicking the “hosted by” area. For attendees, names
                    of those whom the user has a conection with on LinkedIn will be displayed first, which increases their motivation to attend. We believe this change can be a subtle way to increase user’s desire to go to events, by meeting with his
                    friend first, then also other people. This progression for meeting new people is also what we learned from user feedback: you build stronger connections if you and someone has attended few events together. Through such cycle, a user’s
                    connections become more diverse and stronger, which achieves our redesign goals.

                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>This is the first redesign project I've done, but I still found a lot of interesting things during the design process. The first challenging part was that we had to find out what resources are available to us to re-create the style and
                    layout of the current linkedln app. We were struggled to search for the fonts and other UI elements. Another surprising thing was that we always found redundant features or elements after we finalized an idea, we had to spend more
                    time on creating a brand new feature.

                <h2>Final Thoughts and Future Plan</h2>
                <p>Reflecting on our design process, the most exciting feature we developed was the event function that helps different group members to network in professional setting. The data we collected signified that users would like to have various
                    kinds of events other than professional meetings.
                    <p>For our future plan, we want to build more features and have deep integration with more of the connection tools. Additionally, we want to enlarge our user groups and promote this product to working professionals instead of only focusing
                        on college graduates.
