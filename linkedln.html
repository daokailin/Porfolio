                <h2>Personal Introduction</h2>
                <p>It's hard to describe my main role in this project. Each of us spent a great amount of effort on intiating the redesign idea and contributed to different parts of this project. From my perspective, my major responsibility was to finalize
                    our design idea and give suggestion to the prototypes and explaination. When we were designing the high-fidelity prototypes, I was mainly focus on how to incorporate other social media app's advantages into our project. Additionally,
                    I was concentrate on the readability and overall layout of the app. Although the aesthetic was the last thing we concerned about, I tried to make sure everything looks nice and clean to attract users' attention.

                <h2>Identify the Problems</h2>
                <p>The current Linkedln mobile app is lacking the basic meetup funtion as a social media platform geared to professionals. The existing "My Network" function doesn't provide users with appropriate meeting opportunities to communicate with
                    people who share the same interests and passions in person. </p>
                <p>Thus, we are dedicated to implement a new function that helps users to learn knowledgeable skills and industry experience through "real connection."</p>

                <p>1. We sent out online google form surveys to our friends and colleagues who have used linkedln app before. The goal of using this method was to see how college grduates interact with the existing group feature and find out the trends of
                    their expectation or needs of networking experience.
                </p>
                <p>2. Our team conducted two observational interviews collect more in-depth information about these participants' user experience. We asked them to share their experience of meeting with professionals on linkedln, and we recorded how they
                    used the My Network feature to find their interested groups. </p>

                <p>70% of the users stated that they liked the calendar bview since it's a direct visual representation of the event timeline. We simplified the calendar from monthly to weekly in order to retain only necessary informtion and conserve space.

                <p>This is the first redesign project I've done, but I still found a lot of interesting things during the designing process. The first challenging part was that we had to find out what resources are available to us to re-create the style
                    and layout of the current linkedln app. We were struggled to search for the fonts and other UI elements. Another surprising thing was that we always found redundant feature or element after we finalized an idea, we had to spent more
                    time on creating a brand new feature.

                <h2>Final Thoughts and Future Plan</h2>
                <p>Reflecting on our design process, the most exciting feature we developed was the event function that helps different group members to network in professional setting. The data we collected signified that users would like to have various
                    kinds of events other than professional meetings.
                    <p>For our future plan, we want to build more features and have deep integration with more of the connection tools. Additionally, we want to enlarge our user groups and promote this product to working professionals instead of only focusing
                        on college graduates.
