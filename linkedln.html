Linkedln users should have more opportunities to meet with local professionals and engage in networking. </p>

                <h2>Identify the Problems</h2>
                <p>The current Linkedln mobile app is lacking the basic meetup funtion as a social media platform geared to professionals. The existing "My Network" function doesn't provide users with appropriate meeting opportunities to communicate with
                    people who share the same interests and passions in person. </p>
                <p>Thus, we are dedicated to implement a new function that helps users to learn knowledgeable skills and industry experience through "real connection."</p>

                <p>1. We sent out online google form surveys to our friends and colleagues who have used linkedln app before. The goal of using this method was to see how college grduates interact with the existing group feature and find out the trends of
                    their expectation or needs of networking experience.
                </p>
                <p>2. Our team conducted two observational interviews collect more in-depth information about these participants' user experience. We asked them to share their experience of meeting with professionals on linkedln, and we recorded how they
                    used the My Network feature to find their interested groups. </p>

                <p>Many chronic fatigue apps focus mainly on jetlag, but our app looks at chronic fatigue as a whole. We market to a variety of consumers, and have features like the calculator app that benefit students as well as the plan setting that benefits
                    travelers. The products showing above require extensive amount of data input; however, our app only takes 1-2 minutes and is more accurate.

                        For the design, we were inspired by minimalistic applications. Our main goal is to create an interface that is user-friendly and adovated for any user. However, the color scheme of the application has been changed to a blue color palette. We decided to
                        finalize on softer pastel colors since it correlates with sleep to an extent, but it still enhances light. We are focusing on helping our users with chronic whether it is during the day or during the night, therefore, we wanted
                        our color scheme to correlate with the purpose of the app.</li>

                        driving by testing their kinetic visual acuity; the other one aims to assess the player’s alertness for study/work by testing their attention and processing speed via Stroop effect tests. We also included a graph record of the
                        user’s alertness and productivity to increase a sense of continuity.

                <p>Reflecting on our design process, the most exciting feature we developed was the “calculator”, which we came to an agreement after doing a great deal of user testing and surveys.<b> The calculator function provided our users a smart tool to keep tracking their health condition and productivity.</b></p>

                <p>For our future plan, we want to build more features and have deep integration with more of the fitness trackers on the market to become a universal solution. Additionally, we want to enlarge our user groups and promote this product to
                    working professionals.
